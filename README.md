This is an implementation of the SINDy algorithm as described in the paper:

Brunton, S.L., Proctor, J.L. and Kutz, J.N., 2016. Discovering governing equations from data by sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems. Proceedings of the national academy of sciences, 113(15), pp.3932-3937. URL: https://www.pnas.org/content/113/15/3932.short

The algorithm is applied to determining coefficients of the Lotka-Volterra system and Lorenz system.
